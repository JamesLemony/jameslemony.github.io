Reported Speech, biri ya da birilerinin söylemiş olduğu cümleleri, başkalarına aktarırken kullandığımız bir kalıp. Reported Speech’te, reporting verb’ler (agree, complain, mention, say, tell gibi…) kullanılır.

Said, direct speech’te de kullanılır.

“No, you can’t!” he said.
She said, “Good morning.”

> [!INFO] Eğer “tell” kullanacaksak, kime söylediğimizi de belirtmek zorundayız.
> I already said I was sick.
> I already told you I was sick.

> [!NOTE] Reported Speech ile cümle kururken, kurduğumuz cümledeki tense, cümlenin kurulduğu tensin bir gerisindedir. Yani tense, bir past’a atılır.
