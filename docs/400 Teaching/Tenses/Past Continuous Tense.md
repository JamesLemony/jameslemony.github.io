> [!INFO] Past Continuous Tense kullanmamız, ne anlatmak istediğimize bağlıdır. Bu tense biz, genelde, "bir şey oluyorken başka bir şey oldu" gibi cümlelerde kullanırız. Eğer tense'i continuous yapmaya gerek yoksa, continuous yapmayız. Bu şekilde cümleler kurarken de "when" veya "while" gibi bağlaçlar kullanıyoruz.
