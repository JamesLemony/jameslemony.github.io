Cümle yapısı iki farklı şekilde yapılabilir. Cümle will ile yapılırsa, yapılacak olan eylemin gerçekleşeceği tam olarak kesin değildir. Eylemin yapılacağına dair bir kanıt yoktur. Eğer be going to kullanarak yaparsak, o eylemin gerçekleşme ihtimali çok daha yüksektir. Kanıt vardır. Be going to kullanıyorsak, o eylem önceden planlanmış da olabilir. O anda aklımıza gelen bir şey ise will kullanırız.
