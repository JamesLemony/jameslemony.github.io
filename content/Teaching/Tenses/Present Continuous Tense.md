Present Continuous Tense, Türkçeye şimdiki zaman diye çevrilir. Türkçe ile kıyaslandığında, kullanımı neredeyse aynıdır. Şu anda gerçekleşen eylemleri anlatırken kullanılır. Cümle yapısı oldukça basittir.  

Present Continuous Tense’in yardımcı fiili “be”dir. Fakat be, cümlelerin içinde olduğu gibi kullanılmaz. Her bir özne için çekilerek, am/is/are şeklinde kullanılır.  

**Olumlu cümle yapısı:**  

I am + Ving  
You/We/They are + Ving  
He/She/It is + Ving  

**Olumsuz cümle yapısı:**  

I am not + Ving  
You/We/They are not (aren’t) + Ving  
He/She/It is not (isn’t) + Ving  

**Soru cümle yapısı:**  

Am I + Ving  
Are You/We/They + Ving  
Is He/She/It + Ving
