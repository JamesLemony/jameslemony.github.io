Passive Voice, Türkçedeki edilgen yapıya denk geliyor. Birilerinin eylemleri yapmasından ziyade, eylemlerin yapıldığını belirtmek için kullanılıyor. Bu yapıyı kullanırken dikkat edilmesi gereken en önemli şey, her tense’in, Passive formunda değişime uğraması. Passive’lerde her zaman V3 kullanılır. Bu yapılarda, tense'in kendi yardımcı fiilinin yanında, "be" fiili, tense göre çekilerek kullanılır.
