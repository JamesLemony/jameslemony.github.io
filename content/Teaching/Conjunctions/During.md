Türkçede "sırasında" ya da "boyunca" anlamına gelebilecek sözcüktür. Bir edattır. Kullanımı oldukça kolaydır. Genelde cümlenin sonunda kullanılır çünkü İngilizcede, zaman zarfları, cümlenin sonunda tercih edilir. Fakat tabii ki cümlenin başka yerlerine de gelmesi mümkündür. Eğer cümlenin sonunda değilse, genellikle cümlenin başına gelir.
