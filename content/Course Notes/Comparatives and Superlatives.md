## Comparatives  
Comperatives, ya da üstünlük sıfatları, sıfatların sonuna "-er" eklenerek ya da öncesinde "more" kullanırak yapılır. Comparative yaptıktan sonra, genelde, karşılaştırma yaptığımız şeyi de söyleriz.  

Anlamsal olarak, iki şeyin karşılaştırmasını yapan yapıdır. "O, bundan daha iyidir." gibi anlamlar üretmek için kullanılır.  

| Base Form | Comparative Form |  Superlative Form  |  
|:---------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|  
|   Rich    |      Richer      |    The richest     |  
|   Ugly    |      Uglier      |    The ugliest     |  
|   Kind    |      Kinder      |    The kindest     |  
|   Busy    |      Busier      |    The busiest     |  
| Expensive |  More expensive  | The most expensive |  
| Colourful |  More colourful  | The most colourful |  
|  Modern   |   More modern    |  The most modern   |  

**Cümle yapısı:**  
(more) + adjective(-er) + than  

Weaker = Daha Güçsüz  
Smaller = Daha Küçük  
Smarter = Daha Zeki  

Eğer sıfatımızın sonunda zaten "-e" harfi varsa, Comparative yapmak için sadece "-r" ekliyoruz.  

Large = Büyük  
Larger = Daha Büyük  

Eğer sıfatlarımız 2 heceden daha uzunsa, öncesinde "more" getiriyoruz.  

More Expensive = Daha Pahalı

Türkçedeki "gitgide" yapısını, İngilizcede 2 kere aynı Comparative'i yaparak veriyoruz.  

The weather is getting warmer and warmer.  
Our garden is becoming more and more beautiful.  

Türkçedeki "Ne kadar, o kadar" kalıbını, İngilizcede, ard arda gelen iki farklı Comparative ile yapıyoruz.  

The more you eat, the fatter you get.  
The faster you live, the faster you die.  
The deeper our sorrows, the lauder we will sing.  

## Superlatives  
"Enlik Sıfatları" diye çevirebiliriz. Comparative kalıbındaki gibi, 2 heceden daha kıza sözcüklere "-est" eki geliyor. 2 heceden uzunsa, kelime, başına "most" sözcüğünü alıyor. Buradaki unutulmaması gereken şey, Superlative yaptığımızda, sıfatlarımız, başlarına "**the**" alır.  

Anlamsal olarak bir şeyin "en" olduğunu anlatmak için kullanılır. "En iyi/kötü/hızlı" gibi anlamlar vermek için kullanılır.  

The Weakest = En Güçsüz  
The Smallest = En Küçük  
The Smartest = En Zeki  

> [!INFO]  Eğer Superlative'lerden önce, aitlik bildiren bir kelime varsa, "the" koymamıza gerek kalmıyor.  
>  
> He is my best friend.  
> It is our fastest horse.  
> Can you beat his best record?  
> It was his smartest move.  
> Today is our biggest day ever.  

Eğer 2 heceden fazla ise sıfatımız, başına "the most" ekliyoruz.  

The Most Interesting = En İlginç  
The Most Beautiful = En Güzel  
The Most Expensive = En Pahalı  

> [!INFO]  Bazı sıfatlar, Comperative'lerde olduğu gibi, düzensiz olarak Superlative yapılır.  
>  
> Good --> Better --> The Best  
> Bad --> Worse --> The Worst  
> Far --> Farther/Further --> The Farthest/Furthest  
> Much/Many --> More --> The Most  
> Litte --> Less --> The Least
