Reduction, Ä°ngilizce'de karÅŸÄ±mÄ±za Ã§Ä±kmasÄ± muhtemel, kullanÄ±ÅŸlÄ± fakat bazÄ± durumlarda kafa karÄ±ÅŸtÄ±rÄ±cÄ± bir konudur. Reduction, "indirgeme, kesme, Ã§Ä±karma" gibi bir anlam ile kullanÄ±lÄ±r gramerde. KullanÄ±m amacÄ±, oluÅŸturulan cÃ¼mleyi kÄ±saltmaktÄ±r. Fakat bunu yaparken, bazÄ± durumlarda, anlaÅŸÄ±lmayÄ± zorlaÅŸtÄ±racak ÅŸekilde de bir forma sokabilir cÃ¼mleyi. Genellikle [[Relative Pronouns]] konusu ile birlikte kullanÄ±lÄ±r.  

Genel olarak, bir cÃ¼mleyi reduce etmek istiyorsak, cÃ¼mlenin iÃ§erisinde bir "linking verb"e ihtiyacÄ±mÄ±z var. Genelde bu fiiller "am is are" gibi kelimeler oluyor.  

## Reduction With Present Continuous Tense  
Bu cÃ¼mlelerde bir "linking verb", yani am/is/are, olduÄŸu iÃ§in, reduction yapmak da oldukÃ§a kolay oluyor. YapmamÄ±z gereken tek ÅŸey, hem hem relative pronoun'u, hem de am/is/are'Ä± cÃ¼mleden Ã§Ä±karmak.  

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> I do not know the people ==who are== waiting at the front door.  
> I do not know the people waiting at the front door.  
>  
> Is that the cat ==that is== making that noise?  
> Is that the cat making that noise?

EÄŸer cÃ¼mlemin iÃ§erisinde "sahiplik" anlamÄ±na gelen bir "have/has" sÃ¶zcÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼m varsa, bu kural biraz esnetilir ve farklÄ± bir ÅŸekilde yapÄ±lÄ±r.  

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> The house ==which has== a nice terrace is very expensive.  
> The house ==with== a nice terrace is very expensive.  
>  
> The people ==who have== interesting hobbies tend to be more creative.  
> The people ==with== interesting hobbies tend ot be more creative.  

## Reduction in Passive Sentences  
Passive olan yapÄ±larda reduction yapmak Ã§ok daha kolaydÄ±r. Passive yapÄ±larda "be" fiilinin bir tÃ¼revi bulunur. Reduction yapmak iÃ§in yapmamÄ±z gereken, relative pronoun'u ve "be" fiilini cÃ¼mleden Ã§Ä±karmaktÄ±r.  

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> The research ==which was== carried out by the academicians revealed interesting results.  
> The research carried out by the academicians revealed interesting results.  
>  
> The building ==which was== demolished in 2020 will be rebuilt again.

# Problems With Reduction  
BazÄ± durumlarda, cÃ¼mleleri reduce etmek, cÃ¼mlenin anlaÅŸÄ±lmasÄ±nÄ± ciddi ÅŸekilde zorlaÅŸtÄ±rabiliyor. Hatta o kadar zorlaÅŸtÄ±rabiliyor ki bunun Ã¼zerine yazÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸ yazÄ±lar mevcut. Bu durum, genellikle, Ä°ngilizce'deki Passive Voice'un indirgemiÅŸ yapÄ±sÄ±nÄ±n, active Past Tense ile kurulan bir cÃ¼mle ile aÅŸÄ±rÄ± derecede benzer olmasÄ±ndan kaynaklanÄ±yor. Bu ÅŸekilde kurulmuÅŸ cÃ¼mleler, ilk bakÄ±ÅŸta ciddi hatalÄ± duruyor ve genellikle ikinci bir okuma gerektiriyor. DahasÄ±, bazÄ± cÃ¼mleler, birden fazla anlam ile okunabiliyor ve bu durum da "Garden Path Sentence" denilen duruma yol aÃ§Ä±yor. SÄ±kÄ±ntÄ±lar hakkÄ±nda daha detaylÄ± bilgi iÃ§in [link 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence) ve [link 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_relative_clause#cite_note-comprehension247-5)'yi takip edebilirsiniz.  

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> Bu problemleri gÃ¶stermek iÃ§in verilen cÃ¼mlelerden en Ã¼nlÃ¼sÃ¼ sayabileceÄŸimiz cÃ¼mle:  
>  
> The horse raced past the barn fell.

> Bu cÃ¼mlenin uzun hali, Past Tense Passive Voice bir cÃ¼mle olduÄŸu iÃ§in, "be" fiilini ve relative pronoun'u Ã§Ä±karÄ±nca oluÅŸan cÃ¼mlede ciddi anlamsal sÄ±kÄ±ntÄ±lar varmÄ±ÅŸ gibi duruyor. AslÄ±nda cÃ¼mlenin uzun ve aÃ§Ä±k hali ÅŸu:  
>  
> The horse which was raced past the barn fell.  

BunlarÄ±n dÄ±ÅŸÄ±nda, cÃ¼mlelerde neyin Ã§Ä±karÄ±labileceÄŸi ya da Ã§Ä±karÄ±lamayacaÄŸÄ± konusunda ciddi bir bilgi karmaÅŸasÄ± var gibi duruyor nitekim birden Ã§ok kaynak, aynÄ± durumda, Ã§Ä±karÄ±lÄ±p Ã§Ä±karÄ±lmayacaÄŸÄ± konusunda fikir ayrÄ±lÄ±ÄŸÄ± yaÅŸÄ±yor. Ben de bu notumda, en genel anlamda, bÃ¼tÃ¼n Ã¶rnekleri yazmak amacÄ± ile, neredeyse her ÅŸeyi Ã§Ä±karÄ±labilir olarak gÃ¶sterdim.  

###### Other Uses  
Burada yazÄ±lÄ± olanlar dÄ±ÅŸÄ±nda, Reduction, birÃ§ok ÅŸekilde kullanÄ±labiliyor ve kafa karÄ±ÅŸtÄ±rmaya devam edebiliyor. Buradaki kullanÄ±mlar, kullanÄ±mlarÄ±n hepsi deÄŸil ne yazÄ±k ki. Reduction Relative Pronouns konusu dÄ±ÅŸÄ±nda da kullanÄ±labiliyor fakat ben, genel olarak bu konuya odaklandÄ±m.
