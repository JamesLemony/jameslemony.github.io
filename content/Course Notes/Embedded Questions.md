Gömülü sorular anlamına geliyor. Gömülü sorular, bir cümlenin ya da bir sorunun içinde başka bir soru olmasıdır. Kafa karıştırıcı gelebilir fakat aslında oldukça basit bir konsept. Embedded questions, genellikle, kibarlık için kullanılan bir sorudan sonra, asıl sorumuzun **pozitif cümle şeklinde yazılması** ile oluşur.  

Kibarlık için kullandığımız bazı cümle kalıpları şunlardır:  

Can you tell me  
Do you know  
Could you tell me  
Would you know  
Would you happen to know  
Would you mind telling me  
May I ask  
Please tell me  
Do you remember  
Who knows  

Bu sorulardan sonra, asıl sorumuzu, pozitif cümle şeklinde yazmamız gerekiyor.
